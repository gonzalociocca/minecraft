## Default integration config file.
# claimsAutoRegen : This is the list of regions/factions/territories that you wish to auto-regenerate. 
# This is only supported by plugins that can do it. 
# Examples of those that cant: 
# FactionsUUID has a 'wilderness' setting that is automatically assigned to autoregenerate. Nothing else can be configured.
# GriefPrevention considers anything that is not a claim wilderness and doesnt support region naming properly.
